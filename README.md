Transient Time Correlation Function (TTCF)
==========================================
    
This code is intended to runs LAMMPS to get a mother trajectory and then take a range of mirrored child trajectories as required for the TTCF method. The first aim is to match the work of Bernardi et al (2012) (https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4746121), before moving to more complex systems.

The batch running is done using SimWrapPy, which should be automatically downloaded (from https://github.com/edwardsmith999/SimWrapPy)
